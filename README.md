## Kodiri Kodflix Bootcamp Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was built as part of our React training during the 8 Week Kodiri Bootcamp.
We were tasked with reading the requirements and building the app to meet each stage/task.

We used github for version control. Github was also the basis for peer/coach review.
